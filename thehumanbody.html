    <section>
        <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>What are the parts of your body?<br>
            How do they work?</p>
            
            <p>You can easily see the outside of your body.<br>
            You can also touch your skin to feel the structures beneath it.<br>
            But understanding the organs deep inside of you is a little more complicated.</p>
            
            <p>Tens of thousands of years ago, we started giving names to our body parts.<br>
            We hunted animals and compared their bodies to ours.<br>
            But the only times we saw a person's internal organs was if they were badly injured.<br>
            We didn't have x-ray machines back then to take pictures inside of our bodies.<br>
            There wasn't much in the way of surgery -- we didn't even have doctors yet.<br>
            Because of all this, we didn't really know what the internal organs of our body did.</p>
            
            <p>So let's focus on the parts of our body, or anatomy, that we can see or feel from the surface.<br>
            These parts are shaped by the bones and muscles inside of us.</p>

            <h3>Support</h3>

            <p>You don't need an x-ray machine to explore your muscles and bones.<br>
            Poke part of your arm with your finger.<br>
            If you feel something hard, that is probably a bone.<br>
            Bones create a framework to support your body.</p>
            
            <p>The places where bones bend are called joints.<br>
            Some joints work like a ball and socket, allowing freedom of rotation.<br>
            Others bend along one direction like the hinge of a door.</p>
            
            <p>If you feel something squishy, that is probably a muscle.<br>
            Muscles are connected to your bones and they contract and relax to let your body move.<br>
            Muscles can pull, but they can't push.<br>
            Using sets of muscles to pull in opposite directions gives us our freedom of movement.</p>
            
            <p>Poke your nose or your ears.<br>
            These parts are made of a flexible material similar to bone called cartilage.<br>
            Cartilage gives shape to certain body parts without being too hard.</p>

            <h3>Skin</h3>

            <p>The most obvious part of the human body is also the largest -- the skin.<br>
            It covers the outside of our whole body and protects our insides.<br>
            Skin lets us feel different textures and temperatures.<br>
            It comes in different shades of color for different people.</p>
            
            <p>There are other characteristics that skin can have that makes it unique.<br>
            Multiple spots across the face or body are called freckles.<br>
            A single dark spot on the body is called a mole.<br>
            If the mole is on the face, we call it a beauty mark.<br>
            Larger red birthmarks are usually called port-wine stains.</p>
            
            <p>With the basics out of the way, let's start at the top of your head and go down to your toes.</p>

            <h3>Head</h3>

            <p>The head is where your face and hair are located.<br>
            The top part is the skull.<br>
            At the bottom below your mouth is the jaw connected by hinge joints at the top.<br>
            This helps your mouth to open and close.<br>
            On the top back of the head is the crown.</p>
            
            <p>The front of the head is called the face.<br>
            At the top of the face is the forehead.<br>
            Here at the sides of the forehead are the temples.<br>
            Below the temples are the cheekbones and cheeks.<br>
            At the bottom front of the jaw is the chin.</p>
            
            <p>There are two eyebrows here which help to keep sweat from the forehead out of the eyes.<br>
            The eyes are very complex and they allow us to see light.<br>
            We have upper and lower eyelids that can close to cover the eyes for protection.<br>
            On the eyelids are tiny hairs called eyelashes.<br>
            In the inner corner of the eyes are the tear ducts, where tears come from when you cry.<br>
            The middle part of the eye is called the iris, which comes in many different colors and patterns.<br>
            It opens and closes the dark hole called the pupil.</p>
            
            <p>In the middle of the face is the nose.<br>
            At the top is the bridge of the nose.<br>
            The two holes at the bottom are called the nostrils, which allow us to breathe air and smell odors.</p>
            
            <p>The mouth is another complex part of the face.<br>
            It allows us to eat, drink, and also breathe air.<br>
            It lets our voices escape our bodies.<br>
            Outside of the mouth are the upper and lower lips.<br>
            If the corners of the mouth are pulled up, we call that a smile.<br>
            If the corners are pulled down, we call that a frown.</p>
            
            <p>Inside the lips and cheeks are the gums.<br>
            From the gum line is where the teeth appear, which are exposed bones.<br>
            The types of teeth are based on the shapes that help you chew food in different ways.<br>
            Incisors chop, canines pierce, and premolars and molars grind.<br>
            The top inside of the mouth is called the roof or palate.<br>
            The muscle at the bottom of the mouth is the tongue which lets us taste our food.<br>
            It also lets us make certain sounds when combined with the other parts of the mouth.<br>
            Deep inside the mouth, we have the tonsils, which help fight certain infections.<br>
            Some people have their tonsils removed when they get sick too often.<br>
            In the back hanging down is the uvula, which helps with swallowing.</p>
            
            <p>On the sides of our heads are the ears.<br>
            These allow us to hear sounds.</p>
            
            <p>The skin on top of your skull is known as the scalp.<br>
            This is where hair grows out of and comes in many different colors and curl patterns.<br>
            The line between the forehead and scalp is called the hairline.</p>

            <h3>Neck</h3>

            <p>The neck is a series of bones and bending joints that connect the head to the rest of the body.<br>
            It allows us to move our heads and look around.<br>
            The front of the neck is called the throat.<br>
            The back is called the nape.</p>

            <h3>Thorax</h3>

            <p>The main part of your body is the torso or trunk.<br>
            No, not like the trunk of an elephant.<br>
            More like the trunk of a tree, where branches or limbs grow from.<br>
            You have limbs as well.<br>
            Your limbs are called arms and legs.</p>
            
            <p>The torso is divided into two main areas.<br>
            The upper part, which is called the thorax, and the lower part, which is called the abdomen.</p>
            
            <p>The front of the thorax is called the chest.<br>
            At the top are the collarbones, connected at the center by the breastbone.<br>
            Under the collarbones is your rib cage, which is made of 12 pairs of rib bones.<br>
            You can sometimes feel these on your sides.</p>
            
            <p>Stretched across the front of your chest are your muscles called pectorals or pecs.</p>

            <h3>Abdomen</h3>

            <p>The front of the abdomen is called the belly or tummy, which rumbles when you're hungry.<br>
            Below your ribs is your waist, which is generally the narrowest part of your abdomen.</p>
            
            <p>Across your belly are the muscles called abdominals or abs.<br>
            In the middle is your belly button or navel.<br>
            This is where your umbilical cord was attached inside your mother to provide you with oxygen and nutrients before you were born.</p>
            
            <p>Between your legs at the front is your groin or pubic area.<br>
            In the front is an organ, either a penis or a vulva for different people.<br>
            This organ has a urethra where pee or urine is removed from the body.<br>
            In the back is the anus, where poop or feces is removed from the body.</p>

            <h3>Back</h3>

            <p>On the other side of the torso is the back.<br>
            Down the middle of your back is your backbone or spine.<br>
            This is a series of joints to where the ribs connect.<br>
            These let you bend your torso.</p>
            
            <p>Here on the upper back, we have the shoulder blades which connect to your arms.</p>
            
            <p>At the bottom of the abdomen is the pelvis, which connects to your legs.<br>
            Humans don't have external tails, but our bodies develop the basic structures of one before we are born.<br>
            This is a curved section of three to five fused bones at the end of the spine below the pelvis called the tailbone or coccyx.</p>

            <h3>Arms</h3>

            <p>The upper limbs are called the arms.<br>
            They attach to the torso at the shoulder joint, which works like a ball and socket to rotate freely.<br>
            Above the shoulder are the deltoid muscles or delts.<br>
            Below the shoulder is the armpit which is where a lot of sweat forms and collects.</p>
            
            <p>The upper arm is where the bicep and tricep muscles are located.<br>
            The bone in the upper arm is called the humerus.</p>
            
            <p>Where your arm bends is a hinge joint called the elbow.<br>
            If you have ever bumped the nerve in your elbow, you may have heard this area called the funny bone because of the weird feeling it gives you.</p>
            
            <p>Here we have the lower arm or forearm.<br>
            The bones side by side here are the radius and ulna, which help your lower arm to twist.</p>

            <h3>Hands</h3>

            <p>At the end of the arm is the hand which lets us touch and interact with things.<br>
            Connecting the arm to the hand is a group of bones called the wrist joint.<br>
            The front of the hand is called the palm.<br>
            There are five fingers, digits, or phalanges attached to the hand.</p>
            
            <p>First, there is the thumb that bends across the palm to touch the other fingers.<br>
            It lets us grab objects.<br>
            Next, there is the index or pointer finger.<br>
            Then there is the middle finger.<br>
            We have the ring finger, and the pinky or little finger.<br>
            On each of our fingers and thumbs, we have fingerprints and thumbprints on our skin.<br>
            These are somewhat unique to each of us.</p>
            
            <p>The fingers and thumb bend at the joints known as knuckles.<br>
            When they are all bent into a ball, we call that a fist.<br>
            From the wrist to the fingertips, there are 27 bones in each hand!</p>
            
            <p>At the ends of the fingers are the thumbnail and fingernails.<br>
            They are made of hard material like claws but are wide and flat.</p>

            <h3>Legs</h3>

            <p>The lower limbs are called legs.<br>
            They allow us to walk, run, and jump.<br>
            Legs connect to the torso at joints called the hips, which also work like a ball and socket.</p>
            
            <p>The muscles and fat deposits at the back of the hip are called the bottom, buttocks, gluteus maximus or glutes.<br>
            They help us to sit comfortably.</p>
            
            <p>The upper leg is called a thigh.<br>
            The muscles in the front of your thigh are called the quadriceps or quads.<br>
            The muscles in the back of your thigh are called the hamstrings.<br>
            The bone in your thigh is called the femur.<br>
            When you sit down, the tops of your thighs become your lap.</p>
            
            <p>Where your leg bends is a hinge joint called the knee.<br>
            The bone in the front is the kneecap or patella.</p>
            
            <p>The lower leg is called the foreleg.<br>
            The front side with the tibia bone is called the shin.<br>
            The bone to the outer side is called the fibula.<br>
            The muscle along the back of the foreleg is called the calf.</p>
            
            <h3>Foot</h3>
            
            <p>At the end of the leg is the foot.<br>
            Connecting the leg to the foot is a group of bones called the ankle joint.<br>
            At the back of the foot is the heel.<br>
            Connecting your heel to your calf is your Achilles tendon.<br>
            The bottom of the foot is called the sole.<br>
            The raised part of the sole is the arch.<br>
            Below the base of the toes is the ball of the foot.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of the foot are the toes, digits or phalanges.<br>
            This is the big toe.<br>
            Next is the index or long toe.<br>
            Following that is the middle toe.<br>
            Then we have the ring toe.<br>
            Here is the little or pinky toe.</p>
            
            <p>When we walk in modern shoes, we move our weight from our heels to the balls of our feet to our toes before taking another step.<br>
            People who wear softer shoes or walk barefoot tend to step on the balls of their feet first.<br>
            This prevents putting too much weight on dangerous ground elements like rocks.</p>
            
            <p>The toes bend at knuckle joints similar to the fingers.<br>
            Each foot is made up of 26 bones!<br>
            On the top of the toes are the toenails, which are hard like the fingernails.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>Head, shoulders, knees, and toes!<br>
            Those are the parts of the human body -- the parts we can see and feel at least!<br>
            Knowing what each part is called helps us communicate what they are doing when performing physical activities.<br>
            It also helps if we aren't feeling well and need to explain where it hurts.</p>
            
            <p>Understanding how we're put together helps us to know what sort of things our bodies can and can't do.<br>
            So get on up and get moving - see how many different ways you can move and bend!</p>
